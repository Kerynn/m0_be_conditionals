# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
  * Comparison operators are probably the most straight forward since it's basically asking 1:1 questions (is x<y, is d=d).
  At least as far as we've learned!

2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
  * I feel good about the logical operators so far it has been comparing two valuables (not sure if this could increase moving forward).

3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
  * These ones would take me a little longer to do. Mostly just reading through the if statements more than once to make sure I was following correctly.
  Also had the potential for more outcomes, so really need to pay attention to details.

4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
  * I spent a lot of time of this lesson. Much more than anticipated and had to readjust my schedule moving forward. I did not know how to run
  Ruby commands in Atom, so spent some time trying to figure that out. I was able to ask my small group though, and Kelsie provided the steps for
  installing atom-runner, and was able to make good progress after that. It still took time though as I would change the variables multiple times
  to get different outputs. It took time, but feel like I had a better understanding by the end.

5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * I think spending time creating more variables and running through different scenarios will increase my understanding. I would like to
  circle back to the mild & medium code challenges to see if I can also run those. I think adding this to my general review time at the end of the week will be helpful.

6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * In the code challenge section, the second challenge asked to set up integers with different multiples (so integer with multiple of 3 or 5).
  I'm not sure how to do that yet, so will make that a part of my general review time. If I can't figure it out through trial and error, probably doing a google search
  or throwing it out to my small group in slack.
